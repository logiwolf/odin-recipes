                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
                    <li> Beat oil and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and vanilla; beat well.</li>
                    <li>Stir together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to egg mixture; mix until combined. The batter will be very thick. Fold in apples by hand using a wooden spoon. Spread batter into the prepared  pan</li>
                    <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake on a wire rack.</li>
